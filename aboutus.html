					<h3>Tina</h3>
					<p>My journey started in Dublin, Ireland where I studied a one year course in Digital Media in a Post-Leaving Cert College called Ballyfermot College of Further Education (BCFE). This led me to applying for the Higher National Diploma (HND) course in Interactive Media Design which was a two year course also in BCFE. Whilst studying at BCFE I was able to apply for a SUSI grant to help fund my studies which I applied for online: https://susi.ie/ </p>
					<p>This grant paid my fees for both courses at BCFE, which consisted of 500 euro a year.
					I applied for the third year BA (Hons) Degree in Interactive Media Design course at Napier University. I applied for this through the UCAS website https://www.ucas.com/. I needed to include my grades from the HND, a reference from my teacher and a personal statement in my application. </p>
					<p>BCFE informed me about SAAS who are paying for my tuition fees this year. To apply for SAAS go to: http://www.saas.gov.uk/
					SAAS can pay up to five years of education for Scottish and EU members. England and Northern Ireland cannot apply for SAAS because education is not free there. </p>
					<p>If you are an Irish citizen like me and considering studying at Napier University, you can also apply for Back to Education Allowance which consists of 160 euro a week. Information about this can be found here: http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/back_to_education/back_to_education_allowance.html</p>
					<p>You must provide evidence that you have been accepted as a student from the University before they will grant you this allowance. A letter with the University’s college stamp should suffice. </p>

					<h3>Stefan</h3>
					<p>I have decided that I would like to bind my future with Interactive Media industry at the end of 6th year spent in St Augustine’s RC High School. 
					I have been editing digital media in my spare time in the past therefore a vision of turning my hobby into a profession sounded very promising to me.
					From numerous career paths that are available to Interactive Media students I have chosen Web Design & Development. 
					I used several blogging platforms as they allow users to publish content online easily and without technical knowledge,
					however I was always curious how they work and wanted to have freedom in generating my own websites.</p>

					<p>Higher Computing grade along with few others worked out to be beneficial while applying for Interactive Media (Web Development) course at Edinburgh College. 
					Typical entry requirements are two passes at Higher. During my first year there I have learnt the basics of HTML and JavaScript. 
					I was also introduced to editing different media, including graphics, sound and animation. Practical classes were well 
					complemented with such theory concepts as project planning and evaluation, user interface design, file formats and their 
					compression. After I passed the first year at Stevenson campus and obtained HNC qualification I was offered a progression
					into HND that was ran at Milton Road. Second year efficiently built up on my skills by introducing more complex web development 
					aspects such as search engine optimisation (SEO), maintaining databases with PHP and responsive design. Furthermore, 
					in contrast to HNC where I was mostly manipulating bitmap graphics, I had a chance to learn the basics of editing vectors.
					My knowledge has been enriched by the principles of professional and legal issues, marketing and advertising.</p>

					<p>Prior to achieving HND certificate I accomplished Graded Unit project. It required few months of development and combining all the 
					skills learnt during those 2 years together. It was demanding but provided me with great foundations for further journey which continued at 
					Edinburgh Napier University. I was accepted to go straight into 3rd, although some lecturers and students recommended going into 2nd instead. 
					It was a big jump and the learning curve significantly increased. So did the expectations. However, appropriate commitment and time management 
					allow for catching up and self-learning at home. The range of optional modules is impressive and overall course structure well planned. 
					It places greater emphasis on working as a team and making use of different Interactive Media backgrounds. I am looking forward to 
					4th year which prepares for employment and offers real experience in the industry.</p>

					<h3>Veronika</h3>
					<p>My journey to web design started with a Dreamweaver course at Pitman Training Centre financed by ILA Scotland, now called
					SDS Individual Learning accounts. You can get up to £200 towards the costs of learning. You can apply at https://www.myworldofwork.co.uk/learn-and-train/sds-individual-learning-accounts-ila</p>

					<p>Very good start to learn how to code interactively and for free is to sign up to codeacademy https://www.codecademy.com/ Start
					with HTML & CSS and you can progress to other courses such as PHP, JavaScript and jQuery. </p>

					<p>Next step was applying to college. I applied to Edinburgh College to a course called Interactive Media (Web Development)
					http://www.edinburghcollege.ac.uk/courses/Computing/Interactive%20Media%20(Web%20Development)%20HND/CR1IM1WB16 and studied first year at 
					Sighthill and second year at Milton Road campus. This course is directly connected with BSc (Hons) Web Design and Development course on which I am enrolled just now. </p>

					<p>Another option is to apply directly to first year at University. This is done through UCAS website https://www.ucas.com/ucas/undergraduate/register. 
					Students need to write a personal statement, where they need to include reasons for choosing the course and relevant skills. </p>

					<p>Full-time Scottish domiciled students and non-UK EU students must apply for the payment of their tuition fees. </p>

					<p>If you decide to study in Edinburgh, you have a big chance to be eligible for funding http://doc.edinburghcollege.ac.uk/courses/prospectus/funding%20information.pdf</p>

					<p>For more information and to register for funding such as student loan go to http://www.saas.gov.uk/full_time/index.htm and click on login in top 
					right corner where you can register your details. You must apply for SAAS every year you are studying if you want help with paying your fees. </p>

					<h3>James</h3>
					<p>My journey in creative studies began shortly after leaving high school in 2012. My grades were fairly average and I wasn't 
					offered any unconditional offers from a single university. I also had no idea what I wanted to study, though a few months into 
					summer I began applying to several colleges for essentially any course I was vaguely interested in. Eventually I got a reply from
					City of Glasgow College stating that they had a course available, similar to ones I had applied for. Despite my poor grades, they 
					offered me a place as their enrollment was low (inspiring, I know). As I had been rejected from every other course I had applied for, I decided to accept. </p>

					<p>My course title was Digital Media for Design and Print. It was an HNC/D meaning it was a two year course (like an HND) 
					but students received an HNC the first year and an HND by the end of the second in case they did not want to progress any further. 
					The course mainly incorporated product design, both in print and in packaging, though there were some 3D and video elements included 
					in the second year. I personally don’t enjoy coding and so upon submitting the web design module, I failed spectacularly. I was offered 
					a chance to resubmit but I decided to pass this opportunity. If I had resubmitted and passed that module, I would have enrolled into
					year three of university. Because I didn't, I had to enroll into year two of my current course. This course was Digital Media (Hons) to 
					which I am currently enrolled at Edinburgh Napier University. The course I'm in now is much more diverse. It's far more digital, meaning
					next to no print work and consists mainly of video, 3D or audio elements. I enjoy these modules. </p>

					<p>Many of those in my college class gave university a miss. I do not recommend this. What I've learned in university is not only more 
					interesting than what I learned in college, but far more lucrative. I'd argue that it is pretty much essential, as almost all of those 
					who didn't progress to university, make little on freelance work as their skills are limited. There's simply too much competition for 
					those skilled only in what I consider the 'print based programs' of the Adobe Suite. You need to broaden your digital skillset to the 
					absolute maximum to be successful afterwards.</p>

					<h3>Dale</h3>
					<p>Hi there! My name is Dale and I started off my path to my current course by doing a 2 year course at West Lothian College. 
					I left High School when I was 17 years old and applied to the NQ Digital Media course at college. The following year I 
					embarked on completing my HNC in Digital Media. My lecturer told me about the connection my College has with Napier and so 
					naturally I applied and was eligible to begin my university career at the 2nd year of the Digital Media course, I am 
					currently completing my 3rd year and am looking forward to completing my Honor Degree next year.</p>
